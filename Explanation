*Sales Prediction Using Python*

Challenge of the project -> Sales prediction involving forecasting the amount of a product that a consumer will purchase, taking
into account the various factors such as advertising, expenditure, target audience segmentation and advertising platform selection.

So here the problem statement demands to built a model which predicts sales based on the money spent on different platforms 
for marketing.

In this dataset we need to use the advertising dataset in ISLR and analyse the relationship between 'TV Advertising' and 'Sales'
using a simple linear regression model.

Linear Regression model is one of the simplest predictive model in Machine Learning. It predicts by deriving a straight-line formula 
based on the data fit on it. But as simple as it is, Linear Regression can still be an effective model such as in use-cases like this.

This contains data on the budget allocated for TV, radio and newspaper advertisements with the resulting sales.

Target Variable
(int) Sales

Predictors
(int) TV - Budget of advertisements in TV
(int) Radio - Budget of advertisements in radio
(int) Newspaper - Budget of advertisements in newspaper

*Explaning the the data*

-> Since Sales is our target variable, we should identify which variable correlates the most with Sales.
   As we can see, TV has the highest correlation with Sales.
-> Backing up the findings using correlation, the relationship between Sales and TV is more linear.

*Looking at the relationship between the predictors.*

-> It seems there's no clear linear relationships between the predictors.

-> At this point, we know that the variable TV will more likely give better prediction of Sales because of the high 
   correlation and linearity of the two.

Building then Evaluating the Models using Linear Regression

-> Model 1: Using all predictors. The results of this model that uses all of the predictor variable will be our basis on the next models.
-> Model 2: Using only TV as predictor. Since TV shows more correlation and linearity with our target variable, trying to predict Sales using only this variable.
            Eventhough TV is more correlated and linear on Sales, this model does not perform well compared to the model that uses all predictors.
-> Model 3: Using TV and Radio as predictors. The top 2 predictor variables based on the EDA above are TV and Radio, so if the combination of these variables 
            makes a better model.
            This model is slightly better than the model that uses all of the predictor variables.

*Conclusion*

TV	          75.500940	 1.865115	 5.513351	 2.348053	 79.200442
TV & Radio	  90.651321	 1.114457	 2.356396	 1.535056	 89.200324


The Linear Regression model that uses the predictors TV and Radio performs the best out of all the models tried.
These results mean that advertising on TV and Radio contribute the most in Sales, and Newspaper advertisements have little effect in Sales.
Based on these findings, it is recommended that the marketer or the business owner shall allocate more budget on TV and Radio advertisements rather than Newspaper.
